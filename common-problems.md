# Common Problems and Their Solutions

While refurbishing laptops, there are some problems you're fairly likely to run into.
Here are some of those problems, and some ideas of how to solve them.

### Some Common Problems

#### Black screen when powered on (RAM issue)

  If there's a problem with the laptop's RAM, it may power on, but fail to boot at all, resulting in a black screen.
  If this happens, try replacing the RAM.

  For more information on RAM, including tips on how to pick the right kind for a laptop, see our [RAM doc](https://github.com/andpersand/FG-laptop-docs/blob/main/RAM.md).

#### Stripped screws

  A screw is stripped when the slot in the top of the screw has been worn down so that a screwdriver can no longer easily unscrew it.

  Some things you can try to get the screw out:
  - apply strong downward pressure and unscrew slowly
  - use pliers to grip the sides of the screw and unscrew it
  - place a rubber band or thin strip of a grippy material between the screwdriver and the screw

  Once you remove the screw, throw it out so that no one can ever use it again.

#### Missing network card

  Some laptops come to us missing a network/wireless card.
  When this happens, first look up the model of laptop and see if you can find information on what kind of network card it was sold with.
  You can try looking at laptops from the same brand in the recycling bins to see if they have a network card you can use.

  When installing a network card, you need to make sure that the slots in the motherboard match the network card.
  Network cards have a few gaps in their contacts, just like ram and SSDs.
  Make sure that the card and the motherboard slot have the same number of gaps.
  You'll also need to attatch the antenna cables to the network card.
  The order/placement of these cables don't generally matter, but it's good practice to match the black cable to the black arrow and the white/light cable to the white arrow, when possible.
