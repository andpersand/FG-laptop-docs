# CPUs

Though our refurbishing process doesn't usually involve replacing a CPU, this page is intended to answer any questions you might have about CPUs.



### General

Currently, there are two main producers of CPUs: Intel and AMD. 
These companies have different naming conventions for their CPUs.

You can use Intel's [website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@PanelLabel122139) to search for a specific processor, or see when that generation was released.


### Naming Schemes

Intel and AMD have different naming conventions for their CPUs.
Understanding these naming conventions can help you guess a CPU's power and age at a glance.

#### Intel

Intel CPU names will look something like this: `Intel Core i5-8250U`

**Core Type**

The first part `i5` shows which Core type the chip has. 
  The options are i3, i5, i7, i9, Celeron, and Pentium (in order from least powerful/expensive to most powerful/expensive).

**SKU**

The bunch of numbers and letters after the Core type (`-8250U` in our example) is the SKU.

**Generation number**

The first number (or two) in the SKU is the generation number.
  The SKU in our example, `8250U`, indicates an 8th Gen CPU.
  An SKU with the number `6660` indicates a 6th Gen CPU. 

**Performance number**

A higher number in the second slot of the SKU means higher performance.
  In our example `8250U`, the performance number is `250`.
  A `6660` processor generally has higher performance than a `6630` processor.

**Product Line**

The letter near the end of the SKU comes from its product line suffix.
  You can find a full list of these suffixes [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058567/processors/intel-core-processors.html). 

  Some of the product lines you'll encounter most often in laptops are:

  **H**	- High performance, optimized for mobile
  **HK** -	High performance, optimized for mobile, unlocked
  **HQ**	- High performance, optimized for mobile, quad core
  **U**	- Mobile, power efficient
  **Y**	- Mobile, extremely low power

**A note on Gen 10+**

Intel revamped its naming scheme starting with the 10th generation processors, so it's a bit more confusing.
  In the SKU, the letter G followed by a number from "1-7" is used for the "Ice Lake" processors, which have Intel Iris Graphics. 
  The more recent "Comet Lake" processors use the older naming scheme detailed above.

**Series number**

In Gen 10+, the last number before the product line suffix is the series number.
  This number can be a 5, 8, or 0.
  A 5 or 8 is for a U series CPU.
  A 0 is for a Y series CPU.

#### AMD
