# Laptop Power Supplies and Charging Cables

Power supplies have three qualities we need to pay attention to when picking one to use with a laptop:
- Volts (V)
- Amps (A)
- Connector/plug type

(example picture with V and A highlighted)

Every laptop should have a sticker on the bottom case that shows what voltage and amperage it requires.

We don't need to worry about using a power supply that matches the brand of the laptop. For example, we can use a Dell power supply for an HP laptop.

### Voltage

The Voltage of the power supply must match exactly. 
  For example, if the laptop requires 19.5V, the power supply must have an output of 19.5V. We cannot use a power supply with 15V or 20V.

### Amps

The amperage of the power supply must be equal to or greater than the amperage on the laptop sticker.
  For example, if the laptop requires 2.5 amps, we can use a power supply with an output of 2.5A, 3.25A, 5A, etc, but we cannot use a power supply with an output of 2A. 

### Connector

Every laptop has a specific power port. We most often see the following types of cords:
- USB-C
